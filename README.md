# Lixie  #

Lixie is infrastructure awareness tool. The name doesn't really matter and
doesn't mean anything.

The goal of Lixie is to be single binary, zero external dependency
tool. Currently there are two planned modes:

- configuration generator for tools ( mainly
  [vector](https://vector.dev) )

- standalone web UI for viewing and categorizing logs (and other events of
  interest later on)

# Functionality

- Lixie can pull logs from Loki, categorize them, and show them.

# TODO

- favicon

- Implement some unit tests?

- Properly vendor static resources (bootstrap CSS, htmx JS)
